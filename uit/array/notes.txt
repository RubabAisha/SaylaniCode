Assigning an empty array literal, as in var a = [], is the same as invoking the Array() constructor without arguments, as in var a = new Array().
Assigning an empty object literal, as in var o = {}, is the same as invoking the Object() constructor without arguments, as in var o = new Object(). Notice, however, that an empty object literal {} is not really empty, as it contains properties and methods inherited from Object.prototype. So, a truly empty object has to be created with null as prototype, like in var o = Object.create( null).
